# 2015 Advent of Code Solutions in Frink

These are the daily solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles using the programming language [Frink](https://frinklang.org/).

To execute Frink programs, you will need the Frink.jar file (available from Frink's website) which runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Full instructions are available on the [Running Frink](https://frinklang.org/#RunningFrink) chapter of the documentation.
