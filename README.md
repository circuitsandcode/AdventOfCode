# Advent Of Code Solutions
## My solutions to the Advent of Code Problems

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) daily puzzles.

I am not providing my Input files since they are unique to each user. If you'd like to execute these, you'll need to download your own input files from Advent of Code.

## Programming Languages Used
Currently working in the language [Frink](https://frinklang.org/). To execute Frink programs, you will need the Frink.jar file which and Java Virtual Machine. Full instructions are available on the [Running Frink](https://frinklang.org/#RunningFrink) chapter of the documentation.

I'm planning on adding other languages soon and will update as that happens.
