# Advent Of Code Solutions
## My solutions to the Advent of Code Problems

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) daily puzzles.

I am not providing my Input files since they are unique to each user. If you'd like to execute these, you'll need to download your own input files from Advent of Code.

My goal in these solutions is education. I tried to err on the side of being explicit and including lots of comments. The code is rarely very concise, but I wanted the flow to be very clear - especially for new programmers.

## Programming Languages Used
Currently working in the language [Frink](https://frinklang.org/). To execute Frink programs, you will need the Frink.jar file which and Java Virtual Machine. Full instructions are available on the [Running Frink](https://frinklang.org/#RunningFrink) chapter of the documentation.

Also developing solutions to years 2015 and 2020 in [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) with the goal of everything running in version 5.1 and 7.1.

I'm planning on adding other languages and years over time and will update as that happens.
