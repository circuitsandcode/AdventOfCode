# 2020 Advent of Code Solutions in Windows PowerShell 5.1/7.1

These are the daily solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles using the programming language [Windows PowerShell 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1).

Most of these solutions use pretty standard cmdlets and should be fully compatible with [PowerShell 7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/). I will test out each script in versions 5.1 and 7.1 and indicate if there are any issues with either version. If needed, I'll try to write a seperate version of the code for the two versions.

I created an Environmental Path in Windows 10 called AdventPath which is referenced by all scripts. This is just the directory where all my Advent of Code input files and program scripts are saved. This referenced is always commented in my scripts so you can find them and modify as needed to match your folder structure.
