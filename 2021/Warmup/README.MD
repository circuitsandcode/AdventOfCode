# Advent of Code 2021 Warmup Exercise 
My office runs an Advent of Code competition each year. This year, they posted a warmup exercise to get everyone excited.

## Example Problem
Each line of input is a non-negative integer. Find the solution by subtracting the sum of the even numbers from the sum of the odd numbers.
For example, if the input was:

4118  
2666  
7528  
3301  
3856  
2756  
4864  
3857  
6329  
8776  

The correct solution would be -21077.

## My Solution
My first programming language as a kid was GW-BASIC. I was feeling a bit nostalgic so I wrote my solution in [Yabasic](http://2484.de/yabasic/) which I have installed on a cheap [Orange Pi Zero](http://www.orangepi.org/orangepizero/).

## Example Input Files
I've included the input files for anyone who would like to try out their own solution.
